Panaetius,underwhose influencethesouloiStoidsrn bemmcmore

and through him oi Scipio Aemilianus, whom he mompanied on the
mission which the conqueror oi Carthage undertook to the kings oi
Egypt and Asia in aliiance with the repnhiic. Tne foreign phdosophy
was next admitted to mould the most characteristic oi aii the pro
ductione oi the Roman mind-its jurisprudence, being embraoed by
along line oi illustrious iegists; and the relative duties oi civss iiie were
defined and iimited by conceptions borrowed hom Stoic morality. lt
was indeed a doctrine which, as soon as the nadonal prejudice against

imported novelties and a systematic cultivation had been surmounted, .

was sure to prove itseii congenial to the strictness and practiculity oi the
oid Roman character; and when in the last struggles of the common-
weaith the younger Cato endeavoured to take up the position oi his
great ancestor as a reformet of manners, his rule of iiie was derived not
only srom the traditione of undegenerate antiquity, but from the precepta
oi Antipater and Athenodorus. The lesson was one not to be soon
lost. At the extinction oi the republic‚ Stoicism lived on at Rome under
tho imperial rhadow, and the government oi Augustus is said to have
been rendered milder by the counsels of one oi its professum but when
the pressure oi an undisguised despotism began, to call out theold
republican feeling, the elective affinity was seen to assert itself again.
This was the complexion oi things which Persius found, and which he
leit. Thai sect, ns the accuser oi Thrasea reminded the emperor, had
produced hod citizens even under the sonner regrina: its present ad-
herenis were rnen whose very deportment was an implied rebuke to the
hubini oi tho imperial court 3 its chief representative had abdicated his
cilicini dntics und retircd into an unpatriotic and insulting privacy3 and
the public recorda oi the administration of affairs at home and abroad
