SAT. I. ’ 11

muddle-headed Rome does make light of a thing, don't you be
walking up and correcting the lying tongue in that balance of

theips, or asking any ropinion but your own—for who is there at
Rome that has not—if I megla! only say itl But surely I may,
when I lo'ok at these ‘gray hairs of ours, and this dreary way of
living 3 and, in short, all our actions from the time of flinging our
toys auide, when we take the tone of uncles and guardians. Yes,

you must excuse me, then)
F. No, I won't.

P. ‘What am I to do? but I am constitutionallya great laugher,

with a saucy spleen of my own.

‘We shut ourselves up and write, one verse, and another prose,
all in the grand style to be panted forth by the lungs with a vast

we may compare such expressions as ‘Cy·
clopa moveri)

pa'truos, ‘patruae verbera linguae’
Hor. 3 Od. 11. 3, ‘ne sis patruus mihi’
as. 3. 88. ·

nolo is said by the friend, ‘l won't
admit the excuse,' ‘tunc tunc ignoscite'
being only another way of saying ‘fas est
tunc? [Jahn's punctuation (1808) ‘tunc
tunc-ignoscite, nolo ;’ is difficult to un·
derstand.]¹

11. quid faciam, etc, imitated from

Hor. 1 S. 1. 24, who asks the same
question, and appeals similarly to hia
temperament and tastes. Laughter was
attributed to the spleen hythe ancient
physiologists. Pliny 11. 37 (80) ‘Sunt qui
putent adimi simul risum homini, intern-
perantiamque eius constare lienis magnitu-
dine! SerenusSamonicus 439 ‘Splen tumi-
dus uocet, et risum tamen addit ineptum?

petulantes et petulci appellantur
qui protervo impetu et crebro petunt
laedendi alterius gratia' Fest. p. 206.
ed. Miill. (Freund).

cachinno, according to the Schol.
1 noun, like ‘gluto' 5.11a, ‘palpo' ib.
176. Lucilius appears to have been fond
of words of this kind, possibly as being in
use among the common people‚ as ⁸ lurco,’
‘comedo 5. 29: ‘conbibo ' 16. 53, 'man-
do’ luc. 128, ‘catillo ’ 18. 31. [·Comedo'
also in Varro Modius fr. 16 in Riese's ed.
of the Saturarum Menippearum reliquiae]
Hermann, following Heindorf, makes
’ ‘cachinno' a verb, taking ‘ignoscite ..
splene' as a parenthesis—‘Excuse me.
l am sorry to do it, but l cannot help my
spleen3' but this would be awkward:
and though ‘cachinno' as a noun, is

found nowhere else, the evidence of the
Schol. is enough to show that its exist-
ence was not thought impossible at the
time when Latin was still a living lan-
ae.

μΙξ-η. The 'attack begins. P. ‘A
composition is produced with intense
labour. lt is then recited in public by
the author, dressed in holiday attire, with
the most effeminate intonation3 and the
descendants of Romulus are tickled‚ and
feel their passions excited. Shame that an
old man like that should so disgrace
himselfl'

13. The form of the verse was pos·
sibly suggested by Hor. 1 Ep. 1. 117
‘Scribimus indocti,’ etc.

13. inclusi points the satire-‘a man
shuts himself up for days and days, and
this is the upshot! Jahn compares Ov.
Trist. 1. 1. 41 ‘Carmina secessum scri-
bentis 'et otia quaerunt! Juv. 7. 28
‘Qu facis in parva sublimia carmina

cella! Markland ingeniously but need· ·

lessly conjectures ⁶ inclusus numeris ille:
pede liber opposed to ‘numeros'
apparently=‘ soluta oratio,' as no kind of
verse could be well contrastcd with
‘numeri' even Pindar’s dithyrambics
being considered ‘numeri lege soluti!
The stress, however, is laid throughout
the Satire on poetical recitatione, as in
Jnv. S. 1 and 7; and rhetoric is merely
introduced (v. 87) with reference to the
courts of law. ‘Pede liber'=‘pede libero.'
14. grande aliquid, in apposition
to ‘numeros' and to the notion con·
tained in ‘pede liber! ‘Res grandes’
v. 68, ‘Grande locuturi’ 5. 7. ‘Grandis'
seems to have been acant term at Rome
