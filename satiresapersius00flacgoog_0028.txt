LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxv

apparently combining one of the actual requisites of the Roman medley,
the mixture of metres, with the biting invective of the later satire—a
work which, when fixed at its latest date, must have been one of the
concomitants, isnot, as Aristotle thinks, the veritable parent, of the
earlier comedy of Greece. In later times we find parallels to Roman
satire in some os the idylls of Theocritus, not only in those light dia·
logues noticed by the critics, of which the Adoniazusae is the best
instance, hut in the poem entitlcd the Charites, where the poet com-
plains of the general neglect into which his art has fallen in a strain
of mingled pathos and sarcasm which may remind us of Juvenal's
appeal in behalf of men of letters, the unfortunate fratemity of authors.
But Greece was not ordained to excel in everything ; and Rome had the
opportunity of cultivating a virtually unbroken field of‚labour which was ,

the spirit of comedy-of the new comedy no less than the old—the
comedy os manners as wellas the comedy of scurrilous hurlesque -and
investing it with an easy undress clothing, the texture ol which might
be varied as the inward feeling changed, was a great advance in the ’
progress of letters. It would seem to be a test of the lawlul develop-
ment of a new form of composition from an old, that the latter should be
capable of including the earlier, as the larger includes the smaller. So
in the development of the Shaksperian drama from the Greek the
chorus is not lost either as a lyrical or as an ethical clement, but is
diffused over the play, no longer seen indeed, but felt in the art which
heightens the tone of the poetry, and brings out the moral relations ol
the characters into more prominent relies. So in that great development
which transcende as it embraccs all others, the development os prose
· from poetry, the superiority of the new form to the old as a general
vehicle of expression is shown in the expansive flexibility which can
find measured and rhythmic utterance for the raptures of passion or
imagination, yet give no undae elevation to the statement of the plainest
matters of fact. And so it is in the generation of satire from comedy}
the unwieldy framework of the drama is gone, but the dramatic power
remains, and may be summoned up at any time at the pleasure of the
poet, not only in the impalpable shape of remarks ou human character,
hut in the flesh·and·blood sulness os actual dialogue such as engrosses
several os the satires of Horace, and enters asa more or less important
ingredient into every one of those of Persius. Or, if we choose to
regard satire, as we are sully warranted in doing, in its relation not
only to the stage but to other kinds of poetry, we shall have equal
reason to admire it for its elasticity, as being capable of rising without
