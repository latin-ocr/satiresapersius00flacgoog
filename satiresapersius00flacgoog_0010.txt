PREFACE. vii

ol Persius, two ol which are in the Gale collection in the
library os Trinity College, Cambridge. One ol these is known
as Bentleys Codex Galeanus, and is lettered γ by Jahn in
his edition of 1843. ‘It is? says Mr. Conington in his descrip-
tion οἱ it, ‘a small vellum MS. of the 8vo or 12mo size. It
contains Horatii Opera, Persii Satirae, Theodali Eclagae,

. Cato de Moribus, and Aviam' Fabulae. Collations ol the Avi-

anus, the Persius, and the Cat0, were published in the Classical

Joumal,<vol. 4, the former at pp. 120 foll., the two latter at Ι

pp. 35 3 soll, by M. D. B. The Persius collation is very scanty
and not always accurate: but it appears to be the only one
known to Jahn. Mr. Bradshaw refers the MS. to the twelfth
or thirteenth century, almost certainly the former.' The other
MS. in the Gale collection is referred by Mr. Bradshaw to the
ninth or tenth century, and is the most valuable ol the seven
MSS. collated. It consists of one hundred and ten folios in ¹
quires of eight, beginning on the second solio os the first quire,
and contains Juvenalr's Satirae 1. Aaaatatio Cornuti 93, Persii

Satirarum Praemium 94 verso, Persii Satiraa 9 5. ‘It appears,'
(I quote from Mr. Conington) ‘to be written throughout in the

same hand, the glosses being written in a much smaller cha-
racter. , The only doubt is about certain glosses on the margin
of the first four pages of the Persius (fol. 94 versa to fol. 96), ⁴
where the letters are tall and thin, not, as generally, broad and
liat. The characters, however, appear to be the same. There
are other glosses, apparently written at the same time as the
text and in the same hand, some between the lines, some
towards the margin, evidently earlier than those just spoken
of, which in one place leave a space in the middle of a line lor
an intrusive word of the earlier gloss written out ol the straight ,

line. These earlier glosses are much less copious than the later: v

they extend, however, somewhat further, to lolio 98, the end
