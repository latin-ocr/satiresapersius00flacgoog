an end to this trouble that has been weighing on mez’ so says
Chaerestratus as he bites his nail to the quick. ‘Monstrous that
I should be an open scandal to my sober relatives, and bring my
patrimony to a smash, while I sing drunken songs at Chrysis'
dripping door with my light out! ‘Brav0, young gentleman, show
your sense; kill a lamb to' the powers that preserve us! ‘But
do you think she’ll cry, Davus, when I've left her?' ‘Now you ‘re
trifling. She'll be boxing your ears with her red slipper, my boy.
No, no; don’t go and be restiff at one moment and gnawing at

171. Jahn makes Davus' speech end
with dicas, so that Chaerestratus is sup-
posed to say haud mora, ‘anon’ or
‘coming directly ;' but ‘cum arcessor'
evidently refers to si vocet. In Terence,
the lover has received a summons before
the scene begins, and he deliberates whe-
ther to obey it. ln Persius he is trying

whereas, according to Jahn's punctuation,
it would have none.

haud mora then means, ‘ you would
instantly say, What am l to do nowi'

172. nec nunc, apparently for ‘ne nunc
quidem,’ as in Hor. a S. 3. 259 foll, and
twice in Petronius-perhaps, as Jahn
thinks, a colloquialism.

Jahn reads arcessat from one
MS, to agree with ‘supplicet’ which is
the reading of all the MSS. but two. He
appears right in his reasoning that either
the ind. οι conj. would be admissible
in this construction, the one actually
occurring in the parallel passage from
Terence, the other in that t'rom Horace;
but this only helps us a little way to the
true reading, as the extemal authority is
about equal for ‘arcessat-supplicet,’
‘arcessar-supplicet,' and ‘arcessor-
supplicat,’ which last is supported by
Bentley on Hor. l. c. Here, as in a.
45, the form ‘accerso’ is supported by .
the majority of the MSS. See Freund s. v.
