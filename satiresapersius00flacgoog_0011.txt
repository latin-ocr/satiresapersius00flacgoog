viii PREFACE.

ol Sat. 1, after which they almost disappear, scarcely averaging
one in a page? The chief peculiarity of the writing of this MS.
(which Ι have myself collated with Jahn’s text of 1868) is the
shape‘ ol r, which is so formed as to be easily confused with u.
I initial is often written tall, so thatin Sat. 4. 35 it is not at
first sight easy to decide whether the reading is in mores or
lu‘ mores. As regards orthography, this MS. is much freer from
mistakes than the MS. ol Juvenal bound in the same cover and
apparently written by the same hand, in the tenth satire of
which I found such misspellings as gretia lor Graecia, conates
for canities, contentus for concentus, sotio for socio, and tltomatula
for tomacula. This confusion between cand t is almost un-
known to the MS. of Persius: patritiae (Sat. 6. 73) being per·
haps the only instance ol it. In Sat. 1. 116, however, it is diffi-
cult to make out whether the scribe has written muti or muci.
The chief confusions of consonants which this MS. exhibits are
between b 3ηά p (obtare lor optarc,'rapiosa for rabiosal: between
g 3ηά gu (pingue for pinge, longuos for longao: between s 3ηά
ss (ammiras, asogrna for amissus, assigna: cassiam, recusso lor
casiam, recuso, etc.): between m and mm, p and pp, e and cc
(imitere for immittere, ammomis for amomis, suppellex for supellex,
quipe for quc'ppc, peccori for pecori, etc.) Among the vowels‚ a
and o are occasionally confused, as centurionum, Solones for
centurionum, Solones: so with o and u (fumusa, fortunare for
fumoso, fortunare ; sopinus, conditor for supinus, conditur) : to say
y nothing of the interchange, common in such MSS, of ae and e,
yand i. The monosyllabic prepositions are almost invariably
joined with' their nouns (ctumulo, inlunum, etc.) and sometimes
even assimilated. The same is often the case with monosyl-

labic conjunctions (cumscrc'bo noncoctn, sioocet, etc). In words

·“ compounded with in, the preposition is sometimes assimilated,

sometimes not3 thus we find inprimit, inprobe, conpossitum by
