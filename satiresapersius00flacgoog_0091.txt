30. phalerae, contemptuously to an
‘eques,' as the word is peculiarly used of
ahorse's trappings, while it means alsoa

. military ornament. ‘Multo phaleras su·

dore receptas' Virg. Aen. 9. 458. ‘Equites
donati phaleris' Livy 39. 31.

ego te intus et in cute novi.
‘I know what lies under those trappings.'

31. ad morem, more commonly ‘in
‘ex more,' or‘ more.'

discincti. ‘discinctus aut perdam
nepos' Hor. Epod. 1. 34.

Natta is another character from
Horace (1 S. 6. 124), where he appears
not as a reprobate, butas a man of filthy
habits.

32. sed, apparently used to show that
the parallel does not now hold good, being
ratherio Natta's favour. Persius could
not seriously think Natta’s case better
than that os the man whom ‘a little
grain of conscience makes sour,' any more
than mortification is better than acute
disease-indeed his description shows that
he is sully alive to the horror of the state
of moral death: but it is his object to
enforce the stings of remorse, so, without
drawing any direct comparison, he exhibite
the former brietly, and then proceeds to
dwell more at length on the latter.

stupet. . vitio, like ‘stupere gaudio'

l .

Cael. in Qrint. 9. 3. 58 (Freund). [Ἔτι
τούτῳ &cauponum nol ποΐον αὐτῷ πῦρ, ἡ
ποΐον αὐτοι σίδηρον προσάγω, ιν ἀἴσθηται
ὅτι νενέιιροιται ιι..τλ. Epictetusl. 5. 7.]
fibris' increvit, ‘has overgrown his
beart, 1. 47„ 5. ²9· Madan compares
Psalm 119. 70 ‘Their heart rs as fat as
brawn! So S. Matth. 1315 ἐπαχύνθη
γὰρ ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου. S. John
12. 40 ιιεπῶροιαεν’ αυτῶν τὴν καρδίαν.
opimus is a synonyme of‘ pinguis!

33. pingue is here used substantively,
as Virg. G. 3. 124 ‘Impendunt curas denso
distendere pingui) The application is
analogous to that of ‘pingue ingenium,’
fat causing dullness of perception, though
of course the sense here thought of is tlre
moral sense

caret culpa, a translation oi’ αιιό-
λαστόι tort? or implying that his dead-
ness has virtually deprived him oi respon-
sibility? Such sentiments as Menander
γνῶρ. μονόστ. 430, quoted by Casaubon
and jahn, ὁμηδὲν elidis οὐδὲν ἔξαραρτά·
νει, are scarcely m point, as the αγνοια
here rs ἄγνοια καθόλου or ἐν τῇ προαι-
ρέσει (Arist. Eth. N. 3. 1).

34. bullit, not ‘struggling sends a
bubble to the top‚' as Gifford renders it,
as it would be quite impossible that a body
plunged in water should not do so, how·
ever unresisting, but ‘rises, and makes
bubbles at the surface by stmggling,' as
Cpgaubon, jahn, and Heinr. understand it

37. ingenidm.
