tunny’s rsit ‘Angustoque vagos pisces

183. The tunny was frequently used
in sacrifices, being eaten at the temple,
according to the Scholiast who however
may only be reasoning frorn the present
passage. The tail ol the tunny is large.
Persius probably refers to the whole lish,
not to the tall merely.

natat seems to be like ‘vagos’ in ’

Hor. l. c., referring to the nature of the
fish in its native clement, so that there
is a contrast between ‘amplexa' and
‘natat' as between ‘vagos‘ and ‘angusto
urgere! Compare Ov. A. A. 1. 516 ‘Nec
vagus in laxa pes tibi pelle naret!

tornet, probably referring to the
bulging shape of the jar, which seemed to
erpand with the wine The expressions
in this and the preceding lines appear to
be intentionally contemptuous; but Per·
sius is apt to paint rather coarsely, even
where he does not mean to ridicule. .

184. ‘Labra movet, metuens audiri'

Hor. 1 Ep. 16. 60, of muttered prayer.

sabbata pallos. ‘Metuentem sab·

note. Persius seems to min up feasts and
fests rather strangely, apparently with the

185. lemures and pericula are appa·
rently constructed with ‘incussere’ though
in that case we must suppose a zeugma.

ovo pericula rupto. The Scho-
liast says priests used to put eggs on the
fire and observo whether the moisture came
out· from the side or the top, the burst-
ing of the egg being considered a very
dangerous sign. This observation was
called ὠοσκοπική, Jahn.

186. Two kinds of superstition—the
old one oi Cybele and the later one of
Isis imported from Egypt.
