any ungraceful effort from light ridicule to heightened earnestness-
passing at once with Horace from a ludicrous description of a poet as
a marked man, to an emphatic recognition of his essential greatness; or
with Juvenal from a sneer at the contemptible offerings with which the
gods were commonly propitiatcd, to a sublime recital of the blessings
which may lawfully be made objecta of prayer. This plastic compre·
hensiveness was reahzed by the earlier writers, as we have seen, by
means of the variety of their metres, while the later were enabled to
compass it more artistically by that skilful management of the hexa-
meter which eould not be brought to perfectiori in a day. But the
conception appears to have been radically the same throughout; and
the very name satura already contains a prophecy of the distinetive
value of Roman satire as a point in the history of letters.

If, however, the praise of having originated satire cannot be refused to
Ennius, it must be confessed as freely that the influence exercised over
it by Lucilius entitles him to be called its second father. lt belongs to
one by the ties of birth-to the other by those of adoption and edu·
cation. Unlike Ennius, the glories of whose invention may well have
paled before his fame as the Roman Homer and the Roman Euripides,
Lucilius seems to have devoted himself wholly to fostering the growth
and forming the mind of the satiric muse. He is thought to have
so far departed from the form of the old medley as to enforce a
unifonnity of metre in each separate satire, though even this is not
certainly made out; buthe preserved the external variety by writing
sometimes in hexameter, sometimes in iambics or trochaics, and also by
a practice, seemingly peculiar to himself, of mining Latin copiously with ⁴
Greek, the language corresponding to French in the polite circles of
Rome. It is evident‚ ton, both from his numerous fragments and from
the notices of the early grammarianS, that he encouraged to a large
extent the satiric tendency to diversity of subject-at onemoment soaring
on the wing of epic poctry and describing a council of the gods in
. language which Virgil has copied, the next satirizing the fashion of
giving fine Greek names to articles of domestic furniture,-compre·
bending in the same satire a description of a journey from Rome to

’ Capua, and a series of strictures on his predecessors in poetry, whom

he seems to have corrected like so many school-boys ;-now laying down
the law about the niceties of grammar, showing how the second conju-
gation is to be discriminated from the third, and the genitive singular
from the nominative plural; and now talking, possibly within a few lines,
of seizing an antagonist by the nose, dashing his fist in his face, and
knocking out every tooth in his head. But his great achievement, as
attested by the impression left on the minds of his Roman readers,
