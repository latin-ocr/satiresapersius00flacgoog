his fingers; his teeth are exposed and chatter; the rich dainties
, corne back again from his dropping jaws. The upshot is horn-
blowing and tapers; and at last the deceased, laid out on a high
bed and daubed with coarse oiutment‚ turns up his heels stark and
, stiff towards the door; and citizens of twenty-four hours standing
in their caps of liberty carry him to the grave.

serves. The word seems to be found
nowhere else, but it is supported by the
analogy of ‘quadrantal'
