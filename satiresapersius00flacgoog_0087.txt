as he confesses its difficulty, and apparently
inclines to Hauthal’s conj. ‘Qu’
‘Pindon’ ⁴ I am bursting,’ is supported by
ffoffl S. 3. 135 ‘Rumperis et latras'

“ (quoted by Heinr. who himself reads ‘fin-
ditur’). The remainder of the verse is
thrown in by the narrator abruptly, but
not unnaturally, as we have only to supply
‘clamat’ or some such word.

capillis=‘pilis.'

11. chartae, ‘the papyrus?

12. The ink is too thick at first-

the better attested reading]
