SATURARUM

LIBER

PROLOGUS

Nec fonte labra prolui caballinolya
nec in bicipiti somniasse Parnaso

‘My antecedente, 1 believe, were not
poetieal: if I appear at the feast of the
poets, it is only on sufferance. After all,
one can sing without inspiration: at least
parrots and magpies do!

The Prologue may be rev g‘arded m two
aspects, both historical. It may be m·
tended as a remnant of the old practice of
writing the Sutura' ιιι a variety of metres.
There is some reason to think that it is
actually an imitation of Lucilius, as one
of the speakers in Petronius’ Satyricon,

scazous, the rest hexameters. On the
other hand, the introduction of a Pro·
