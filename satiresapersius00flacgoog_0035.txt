xxxii LECTURE ΟΝ PERSIUS.

represented to me and, as it were, forced on me by the example of a
writer of our own country, perhaps the most remarkable ol the present
time, wh0, though differing as widely from Persius in all his circum-
stances as aworld·wearied and desponding manos the nineteenth century
can differ from an enthusiastic and inexperienced youth ol the first,
still appears to me to bear a singular resemblance to him in the whole
character of his genius-I mean Mr. Carlyle. If Persius can take the
benefit of this parallel, he may safely plead guilty to the charge of
not having escaped the vice ol his age, the passion for refining still
further on Augustan refinements of expression and locking up the
meaning of a sentence in epigrammatic allusions‚ which in its measure
lies at the door even of Tacitus.

Ι have exhausted my time and, Ι sear, your patience also, when my
subject is still far from exhausted. Ι am glad, however, to think thatin
closing I am not really bringing it to an end, but that some of my
hearers to·day will accompany me to-morrow and on future days in the
special study osone who, like all great authors, will surrender the full
knowledge of his beauties only to those who ask it of him in detail.
