or from the variety of measures of which it was composed-a more
professional and artistic exhibition than the Fescennine bantering·
Ἴ matcheS, but far removed from the organized completeness of even the

earlier drama. It was on this narrow ground that the independence of
the Roman genius was destined to essert itself. Whether from a wish
to take advantage of the name, or to preserve a thing, once popular,
from altogether dying out in the process of improvement, a feeling which
we know to have operated in the case of the exodia or interludes intro-

duced into the representation of the Atellane plays, Ennius was led to ⁸
produce certain compositions which he called satires, seemingly as
various both in character and in versification as the old dramatic
medley, but intended not for acting but for reciting or reading-in
other words, not plays but poems All that we know of these is com-
prised in a few titles and a very few fragments, none of which tell us
much, coupled with the fact that in one of them Life and Death were
introduced contending with each other as two allegorical personages,
like Fame in Virgil, as Quintilian remarks or Virtue and Pleasure in

κ the moral tale of Prodicus Little as this is, it is more than is known of

the satires of Pacuvius of which we only hear that they resembled those-
of Ennius What was the precise relation borne by either to the later
Roman satire with which we are so familiar can but be conjectured.
Horace, who is followed as usual by Persius, ignores them both as
satirists, and claims the paternity of satire for Lucilius, wh0, as he says,
imitated the old Attic comedy, changing merely the measure3 nor does
Quintilian mention them in the brief but celebrated passage in which he
asserts the merit of the invention of satire to belong wholly to Rome.
This silence may be taken as showing that neither Ennius nor Pacuvius
gave any exclusive or decided prominence to that clement of satire
which in modern times has become its distinguishing characteristic-.-
criticism on the men, manners, and things of the day; but it can
scarcely impeach their credit as the first founders of a new and ori-
ginal school of composition. That which constitutes the vaunted
originality of Roman satire is not so much its substance as its form:
. the one had already existed in perfection at Athens, the elaboration
of the other was reserved for the poetic art of Italy. It is certainly
not a little remarkable that the countrymen of Aristophanes and
Menander should not have risen to the full conception of familiar
compositions in verse in which the poet pours out desultory thoughts
on contemporary subjects in his own person, relieved from the trammels
which necessarily bind every dramatic production, however free an'd
unbridled its spirit. That such a thing might easily have arisen among
themis evident from the traditional fame of the Homeric Margites, itself
