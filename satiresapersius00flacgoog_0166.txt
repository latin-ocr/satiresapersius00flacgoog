2. 63. ‘Et bona dis ex hac scelerata ducere pulpa!

The expression pulpa reminds us (as l have hinted inan additional note
on the passage) oi the use of σάρξ as opposed to ψυχή in the later philoso-
phical schools of Greece. Zeller (Philosophie d. Griech. 3. 1. p. 405) thinks
that σάρξ was first employed by Epicurus as a more exact expression than
σῶμα for body as opposed to mind. ln a letter of Epicurus quoted by
Diogenes Laertius σάρξ occurs several times (137, 140, 144, 145), being
opposed in one passage to ψυχή, iu another to διάνοια. The passages quoted
inthe note from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to show that the
word was current in 'the ordinary polemics of the Stoics and Epicuream.
Their use of the word must of course be distinguished from its theological
applications, whether Greek or Judaic, on which an essay by Dr. Hermann
Ltidemann (Die Anthropologie des Apostels PauluS, Kiel 1872) may be
consulted with advantage. The transition to a quasi-theological use would
however be easy, were σάρξ or caro contrasted (as Persius contrasts pulpa)
with the nature of the Deity3 and possibly such a turn may have been
more familiar to the popular Stoical discourses‚ whose tone Persius con-
stautly reproduces, thau the existiug evidence enables us to prove. lt
should be observed, with regard to Zeller's remark on the difference
apparently drawn by Epicurus between σάρξ and σῶμα, that Seneca is less
precise, and uses caro-and corpusculum as virtualiy synonymous: ‘Nunquam'
me caro ista compellet ad metum ..... nunquam in honorem huius cor-
pusculi mentiar! (Ep. 65. 22.)
