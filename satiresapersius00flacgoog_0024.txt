LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxi

in which Lucretius is the poet of Epicureanism, as if there were equal
scope for the exposition of a philosophy in a few scholastic exercises
and in an elaborate didactic poem. On the other hand, it should be
recollected that under the iron grasp 0f the Roman mind, Stoicism, as
was just now remarked, was being reduced more and more to a simply
practical system, bearing but a faint impress of those abstruse cosmo-
logical speculations which had so great a charm for the intellect 01 Greece
even in its most sober moments, and exhibiting in place of them an
appHcability to civil life the want of which had been noted as a defect in
the conceptions of Zeno and Chrysippus¹. The library and the lecture-
room still were more familiar to it than the forum or the senate; but the
transition had begun: and though Persius may have looked to his seven
hundred volumes for his principles of action, as he did to Horace for in-
formation about the ways of the world, the only theory which he strove
to inculcate was the knowledge which the founders of his sect, in com-
mon with Socrates believed to be the sole groundwork 01 correct prac-
tice. Using the very words 01 Virgil, he calls upon a benighted race to
acquaint itself with the causes of things: but the invitation is not to that
study of the stars in their courses‚ of eclipses and earthquakes and
inundations‚ of the laws governing the length 01 days and nights, which
enabled Lucretius to triumph over the fear of death, but to an inquiry
into the purpose of man's being, the art of shilful driving in the chariot·
race of life, the-limits to a desire of wealth and to its expenditure on
unselfish objects, and the ordained position of each individual in the
social system. Such an apprehension 01 his subject would naturally lead

Ι him not to the treatise, but to the sermon-not to the didactic poem, but

to the satire or moral epistle. But though the form of the composition
is desultory, the spirit is in the main definite and consistent. Even in
the first satire, in which he seems to drop the philosopher and assume
the critic, we recognize the same belief in the connection between intel-
lectual knowledge and practice, and consequently between a corrupt
taste and 3 relaxed morality, which shines out so clearly afterwards when
he tells the enfranchised slave that he cannot move a finger without
committing a blunder, and that it is as portentous for a man to take
part in life without study as it would be lor aploughman to attempt to
bring a ship into port. It is true that he follows Horace closely, not
only in his illustrations and descriptions 01 manners, but in his lessons
01 morality-a strange deference to the man who ridiculed Crispinus and
Damasippus, and did not even spare the great Stertinius3 but the evil

and folly of avarice, the wisdom 01 contentment and sslf-control, and the
