fairly, and even if they should be still unvanquished, are at any rate
palpably felt and appreciated. At the same time he presents many
salient points to the general student ol literature ; his individual charac-
teristics as a writer are sufficiently prominent to strike the most careless
eye; his philosophical creed, ardently embraced and realized with more
or less distinctness, is that which proved itself most congenial to the best
parts of the Roman mind, the Stoicism of the empire; while his profes·
sion ol authorship, as avowed by himself, associates him not only with
Horace, but with the less known name of Lucilius, and the original con-
ception of Roman satire.

The information which we possess concerning the personal history of
Persius is more copious than might have been expected in the case of
one whose life was so short and so uneventful. His writings, indeed,
cannot be compared with the ‘votive tablets’ on which his two great
predecessors delighted to inscribe their own memoirs: on the contrary,
· except in one famous passage, the autobiographical clement is scarcely
brought forwardat all. We see his character written legibly enough in
every line, and there are various minute traces ol experience with which
the facts of his life, when ascertained, are perceived to accord; but no
one could have attempted to construet his biography from his Satires
without passing even those extended limits within which modern criti·
cism is pleased to expatiate. But there is a memoir‚ much more full
than most ol the biographical notices of that period, and apparently
quite authentic, the authorship of which, after being variously assigned to
his instructor and literary executor Cornutus, and to Suetonius, is now
generally fixed, agreeably to the testimony of the best MSS, on Valerius
Probus, the celebrated contemporary grammarian, from whose com-
mentary, doubtless an exposition of the Satires, it is stated to have been
extracted. Something has still been left to the ingenuity or research of
later times to supply, in the way ol coniectural correction or illustration,
and in this work no one has been more diligent than Otto Jahn, to whom
Persius is' probably more indebted than to any other editor, with the
single exception ol Casaubon. I have, myself, found his commentary
quite invaluable while preparing my own notes, and I shall have to draw
frequently upon his Prolegomena in the course ol the present lecture.

Aulus Persius Flaccus was born on the 4th of December, nn. 34, little
more than two years before the death of Tiberius, at Volaterrae in
Etruria, a country where antiquity of descent was most carefully
cherished, and which had recently produced two men well known in
the annals of the empire, Maecenas and Sejanus. His father was of
equestrian rank, and his relatives included some of the first men of his
time. The connection of the family with his birth-place is substantiated
