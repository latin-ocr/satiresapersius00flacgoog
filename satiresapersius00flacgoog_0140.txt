SAT. V. 105

clodhopper every other ineh oi you, you cannot dance even three
steps of Bathyllus' satyr.²

‘l'm free for all that' ‘Who gave you leave to think s0‚ you,
the slave ol so many things? Have you no notion oi any master
but the one whom the wand frees you fromi' ‘Hallo, boy, carry
Crispinus’ flesh-brushes to the bath ;' then suppose his tone grows
sharper: ‘Whati dawdling and playing the fooli' the sting ol
bondage does not make you stira step ; nothing is communicated
from without to jerk your wires; hut if within, in that diseased
heart of yours, masters keep growing up, how can you be said
to come off unwhipped, any more than the slave whom the strap
and the terror of his masters has sent running with the flesh·
brushes?

You are snoring lazily in the morning. ‘Get up,’ says Avarice,
‘come, get up! No, say you. She keeps on, ‘Get up? ‘I can't.'
‘Get up! ‘And what am I to dol’ ‘You ask the question! Look

132-160. ‘One morning as you are
sleeping you* are roused by Avarice, who at
last makes you get up and prepare for
avoyage, where you are to traffic in all
kinds os articles and struggle hard to
make your fortune. Just as you are
bustling away, Luxury takes you aside,
rallies you on your mad hurry, reminds
you of the discomforts you are about to
undergo on shipboard, merely that you
may swell your property a little, and ends
by hidding you be wise and enjoy life
while you can. Which of the two will
you follow? you are pulled both ways,
and a single actos resistance to either
does not make you free. Even if you
break your chain, you may still drag it
along wirh you)
