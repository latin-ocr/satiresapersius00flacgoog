and the boss of boyhood was hung up asan offering to the quaint
old household gods, when my companions made themselves plea-
sant, and the yet unsullied shield of my gown left me free to cast
my eyes at will over the whole Subura—just when the way of
life begins to he uncertain, and the bewildered mind finds that its
ignorant ramblings have brought it to a point where roads branch
off-then it was that I made myself your adopted child. You at
once received the young foundling into the bosom of a second
Socrates3 and soon your rule, with artful surprise, straightens the
moral twists that it detects, and my spirit becomes moulded by
reason, and struggles to be subdued, and assumes plastic features

34. 3. 65 note. vitae nescius error
answers to ‘rerum inscitia' Hor. 1 Ep. 3.
33, ‘ignorance of lite or of the world!

J error is here the act of wandering.f
Compare uct. 2. 10 ‘ rrare, atque viam

palantes quaerere vitae’ and Hor. a S. 3.
48 foll. ‘Velut silvis, ubi passim Palantes
error certo de tramite pellit, llle sini·
strorsum, hic dextrorsum abir: unus utris·
que Error, sed variis illudit partibus.’

35. deducit, Jahn (1843), from the
best Mssi‘fdf‘diductt' which the other
editors, and Jalm-r‘n‘his text of 1868,
prefer. lt seems doubtful whether any
appropriate meaning could be extracted
from ‘diducit in com ita,' as ‘c ita’
signifies not the crossways, but thoemiprffi-
tion or p of etms-ing. ‘Q’ will
have its ordinary sense of leading from
one place to another, viz. from the straight
path to the point where the roads begin to
diverge, according to the image explained
on 3. 56. Emphasis is thus thrown on
⁸ vitae nescius error,' the guidance to which
they haveto trust is that oi ignorance
and inexperience, so that they do not
know which way to turn. ,

36. supponere is used of suppositi-
tious children, and of eggs placed under a
hen, the common notion being that of
introducing a person or thing into a place
ready for it, but not belonging to it.
Such seems to be its force here, though it
would perhaps be too much to suppose,
with Jahn, that the metaphor· is directly
taken from children. lt seems, however,
to have suggested ‘suscipis' which is the
technical term for taking up and rearing a
child. ‘Haec ad te die natali meo scripsi,
quo utinam susceptus non essem‘ Cic. Att.
11. 9. ‘Tollere' which is a synonyme oi
‘suscipere’ is used of supposititium chil-

dren Qrint. 3. 6. 97.

teneros-annos is not equivalent
to ‘m‘e‘t'efffi'fflaff' as the words are

not used literally of actual iniancy, but
metaphorically of the intem of 'udgment

which belon sto outh. .

only of wisdom, but, as Jahn remarks, o
the render affection with which Socrates
watched over youth.

fallere sollers is explained by
jahn, ‘quae sollertiam adhibet, ubi de
fallendo agitur-quae non fallit: evidently
an impossible rendering. The words can

only mean ‘skilsul to deceivg’ so that we

mrpst understand thern either of the radutal Θ Ι

virtue Casaubon), or, as ‘Qa—tico’

would suggest, of the Qmwhrrhsur.

ο os to truth (compare 3. 52, ‘curvos
deprendffe mores’) by placing the two Θ
suddenly in mammarum—a view ammi

would perhaps agree better with the lan-
guage of the next line. There seems no
affinity between the sense of ‘fallere’
here, and that of ‘fallit regula’ 4. 12,
though the expressions are similar. ,

38. 3. 52.. 4. 12, notes. intortus,

apparently stronger than ‘ pravus!

ostendit is read by some MSS, but
‘extendit' is better, as showing that the
same process convinced the pupil of his
faults and led him to correct them.

39. premitur. Jahn well compares
Wrg. Aen. 6. 80 ‘fingitque premendo: so
that the word prepares us for the image
of moulding in the next line.

vinci laborat, like ‘obhquo loborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo' Hor. a Od.
3. 12, where a prose writer would have
said ‘vinci cogitur,’ though ‘laborat’ is
doubtless meant to show that the pupil's
mind cooperated with the teacher.
