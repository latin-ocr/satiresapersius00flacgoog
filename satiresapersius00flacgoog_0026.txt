LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxiii

os Stoicism. His piety is simply the rational piety which would approve
itself to any Roman morahst-the piety recommended by Horace, and
afterwards by Juvenal—pronouncing purity of intent to be more accept·
able in the sight of Heaven than costly sacrifice, and bidding men ask
oi the gods such things only as divine beings would wish to grant.
In like manner his humanity, though genial in its practical aspect, is
still narrowed on the speculative side by the old sectarian exclusiveness
which barred the path of hieto every one not entering through the gate
of philosophy. In short, he isa disciple of the earlier Stoicism oi the
empire-a Roman in his predilection sor the ethical part of his creed
yet conforming in other respects to the primitive traditions of Greece-
neither a patriot nor a courtier, but a recluse student, an ardent teacher
of the truths which he had himself learnt, without the development which
might have been generated by more mature thought, or the abatement
which might have been forced up'on him by a longer experience.

We have aheady observed that the character of ¹Persius’ opinions
determined his choice os apoetical vehicle sor expressing them. With
his views it would have been as unnatural for him to have composed
a didactic treatise, like Lucretius, or a republican epic, like Lucan, as
to have rested satisfied with multiplying the productioris oi his own boy-
hood, tragedies and pilgrimages in verse. And now, what was the
nature and what the historical antecedents of that form of composition
which he adopted as most congenial to him?

The exploded derivation of satire from the Greek satyric drama is
one of those not infrequent instances where a false etymology has pre·
served a significant truth. There seems every reason to believe that the
first beginnings of satire among the Romans are parallel to the rudi-
mental type frorn which dramatic entertainments were developed in
Greece. ‘When I am reading on these two subjects,' says Dryden, in
his admirable essay on Satire, ‘methinks I hear the same story told
twice over with very little alteration! The primitive Dionysiae festivals
of the Greek rustic populations seem to have answered with sufficient
exactness to the harvest-home rej0icings of agricultural Italy described
by Horace, when the country wits encountered each other in Fescennine
verses, Nor did the resemblance cease at this its earliest stage. Im-
provised repartee was succeeded by pantomimic representation and
dancing to music, and in process of time the two elements, combined
yet discriminated irorn each other, assumed the form of aregular play,
with its alternate dialogues and cantica. Previous to this later develop-
ment there had been an intermediate kind os entertainment called
the satura or medley, either from the miscellaneous character oi its
matter, which appears to have made no pretence to a plot or story,
