SAT. III. 71

‘Poor creature yourself, feel my pulse and put your hand on
my chest, there's no heat there; touch my extremities, they're not
cold.’ Suppose you happen to catch sight of abit of money, does
your beart beat regularly then? Or say you have a tough vege·
table mess served up on a cold dish, with meal sifted through the

common sieve: now let us examine your palate: ah, you have a

concealed putrid ulcer, which makes your mouth tender, and it
won't do to let that coarse vulgar beet rub against it. So you
shiver, when pale fear sets up the bristles all over you, and then
when a fire is lighted underneath your blood begins to boil‚ and
v your eyes sparkle with passion, and you say and do things which

Orestes the hero of madmen, would depose to be the words and

actions of a madman. βψ

foll. ‘Est etiam calor ille animo quem
sumit in ira, Cum fervescit, et ex oculis
micat acribus ardor. Est et frigida multa
comes formidinis aura, Qua ciet horro-
rem membris‚ et cmcitat artus τ’ a curious

Ep. 119. 3 ‘utrum hic panis sit plebeius
an siligineus ad naturam nihil pertinet;’
‘sifted through the common sieve,’ which
was coarser.

populi, here=‘plebis.'

113. ‘Let us see how your palate is.
Ahl your mouth is tender from a con·
cealed inflammation.¹

tenero, emphatic, a sort of pre·
dicate.

latet ulcus, perhaps from Hor.
1 Ep. 16. 14 ‘Stultorum incurata pudor
malus ulcera celat,’ so as to remind us of
the previous story, ‘a sore which you
have said nothing of to me, your medical

· adviser.' Persius has convicted his patient

of palpitation—he now proves that his
mouth is inflamed-theu shows that he is
feverish-hot and cold alternately.

114. plebeia ¹beta, like ‘panis ple·
beius,’ quoted ou v. 112. The irony is
kept up by the word ‘beta,' beet being
proverbially tender. Suet. Aug. 87 quotes,

as a peculiar expression, from Augustus(

correspondence', ‘betiwre pro languere,
quod vulgo lachanizare dicitur!

radere, like ‘tergere palatum’ Hor.
a S. a. 24, compared by the Scholiast.
Lucr. 4. 528, 532 ‘Praeterea radit vox
fauces. . . . ianua raditur oris.'

115. excussit, of raising suddenly,
but without separation. See 1. 118
note.

aristas, proleptically; ‘excussit pilos
ita ut aristis similes essent! Jahn com·
pares Varro L. L. 6. 49 ‘tremor.. cum
etiarn in corpore pili ut aristae in spica
hordei horrent! Stocker compares with
this and the following verses Lucr. 3. 188

passage in itself‚ illustrating Lucretius'
theory of the composition of the soul or
mind from beat, wind (or sold), and
atmospherie air (the medium temperature)
by the different temperaments of different
animals, and one too which Persius not
improbably had in his mind. See next
note.

116. face supposita; perhaps from

subdita percit! Persius’ metaphor is from
a boiling caldron: compare the simile in
Virg. Aen. 7. 462 foll. ; and this may be
the meaning of Lucr. l. c. 298 ‘Nec
capere irarum fluctus in pectore possunt,'
which answers exactly to Virgil's ‘uec
iam se capit unda?

117. ‘lra furor brevis est’ Hor. 1 Ep. Ι

a. 61.

118. non sanus=‘insanus,' v. 46.
The instance of Orestes is doubtless taken
from Hor. aS.3. 137 sq. ‘Quin ex quo
est habitus male tutae mentis Orestes,
Nil sane fecit quod tu reprehendere possis,'
where Damasippus argues that Orestes
was mad when he killed his mother, not
afterwards. But he was a favourite ex-
ample of madness. Jahu refers to Plato,
Alc. 11. p. 143 D, aud to Gell. 13. 4, who
says that Varro wrote a work ‘Orestes
vel de Insania! Comp. Plautus, Capt. 3.
3. 30‘Et quidem Alcmaeus, atque Orestes,
et Lyeurgus postea Una opera mihi sunt
sodales, qua iste.'
