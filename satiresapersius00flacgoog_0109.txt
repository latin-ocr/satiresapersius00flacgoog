quid deinde loquere? may per·
haps be meant, as Jahn thinks, to show
that the orator had not thought before·

non iustum est. So Alcibiades ιιι
Plato, p. 109, is made to admit that ru deli·
berative oratory τὸ ὧδε holds rs equivalent
to τὸ bracios il ἀδίκωι. Casaubon com·
pares Hor. 1 S. 4. 134 'rectius hoc est:
Hoc faciens vivam melius!

ιο. ‘You have studied philosophy!
Comp. 3. 52 foll. note, where the lan·
guage is substantially the same.

iustum is what rs put into each
scale of the balance. ‘You can weigh
the justice of one course against that of
another!

bus,’ lilre‘ gemmus pes ‘Ov. A.A. a 644.

11. ‘You can distinguish right from
the wrong on either side of rt' -as there
may be two opposite deviations from the
perpendicular—a doctrine not unlike the
Aristotelian theory ol' virtue as a mean,
which Casaubou compares, ‘where it
(the right line) comes in between the
curves! comp. 3. 52, 5. 38.

9· neo·

ιι. dicernis. 16. merecos.

12. The meaning seems ιο be ‘even
(vel) when the rule misleads you by its
deviation,' i..e as Casaubon explains it,
when' justice has to be corrected by equity.

pede, used apparently to suggest the
notion of a foot measure. ‘Metiri se
quemque suo modulo ac pede verum est’
Hor. 1Ep. 7 98.

varo possibly may denote that the
rule branches into two parts. Comp. 6.

theta ; θ, the initial of Θάνατοι, was
the mark of condemnation, apparently
introduced from Greece ιιι place of C
(¹ Condemnoss) which the judges used ιιι
Cicero’s time. Isid Orig. 1. 3. Θ was
also employed' m epitaphs [Brambach's C.
lnsc. Rhen. 391] and hythe quaestors in
striking off dead soldiers' names from the
roll, Mart. 7. 37. 2. The Scholiast and lsid.
l. c. quote a line from an unknown writer,
‘0 multum ante alias infelix littera Thero!

on the would be statesman. ‘Will you
then be so good as to have done with
that?

igitur, as if rt were the natural and
expected consequence for all the admis-
sione in his favour that have been made.
The real reason is given afterwards, v. 17.
