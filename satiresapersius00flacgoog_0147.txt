174. hic is an adverb. nota pronoun,
as ⁴ in festuca ' shows. ‘Qrod petis, hic
est' Hor. 1 Ep. 11. aq, ‘Hic est aut
nusquam, quod quaerimus' ih. 17. 39.

175. festuca, generally explained asa
synonyme for ‘vindicta’ here and in
Plaut. Mil. 4. r. 15 (quoted by Delph. ed.)
‘quidl’ ean’ ingenus an festuca iacta
serva a libera est ? ’ The Scholiast has ‘non
in ea virga qua a lictore percutitur!
Jahn refers to Stephens’ Glossary, p. 96,
‘Festuca, crippus, ῥάβδοι] On the other
hand, Plutarch, De S. N. Vind. p. 550,
says that one of the lictors threw e
on the manumitted slave, w ic would
accord suffilcrenry well with the ordinary
use of ‘festuca,’ as iu Varro L. L. 5. 31.
38 ‘qui homo in pratis per fenisecta
festucas corradit.' ¹ Vis festucaria ’ occurs
in Gell. ao. ιο. 10. At any rate the
word appears to be technical, not used
rhetorically in a contemptuous sense.
Casaubon says that ‘exfestucare’ occurs
in the laws of the Alemanni and Sarnous,
and elsewhere iu mediaeval Latinity.

‘No symbol was of such universal ap-
plication among ancient nations as the
‘⁶ stipula‚” the ‘⁶ festuca,” the ‘⁸ culm,” the
‘'hawm.” Thrice was the hawm to be
cast when the Teuton bequeathed his land
to the stranger in blood. Thrice was the
hawm to be flung down before the sove-
reigp qhen the h'deges refusedhthqlir assent
tote oom; an once waste awm to
be cast up in the air before that Senior
whom his lieges reiected and spurned
away. To tbis usage, therefore, the
sternly indignant Frankish Proceres re·
sorted, proclaiming that they cast off
their faith, and with one act in the open
field-the field of council-did they cast

the hawm-they no longer Charles’s
lieges-Charles no longer their Senior or
King.¹ (Palgrave, Hist. of Normaudy and
England‚ vol. a.)

ineptus, because the ceremony does
not convey real freedom.

176·188. ‘ls freedom compatible with
the vanity of the political aspirant, who
courts the mob and desires to be remem-
bered for the splendour of his official
shows? Or take the superstitious man,
who observes Jewish ceremonies and
seeks to propitiate the wrath of Isis-his
bundage speaks for itself.’ The instances
are rather awkwardly introduced, as we
might bave expected that Persius, having
at last found real freedom, would dwell
upon it, rather than speak of other kinds
of slavery. But there is spirit in the
abruptness, which, at any rate, avoids the
faults of formality and sameness.

176. palpo, 1. 112, equiv. to ‘am-
bitur!

ducit hiantem, imitated from Hor.
1 S. a. 88 ‘emptorem inducat hiantem:
and perhaps from Virg. G. a. 508 foll.
‘hunc plausus hiantem .. .. corripuit:
where ‘hiantem '= ‘avidum' The man
follows with his mouth open, expecting to
receive something. Tbe sense of the
passage appears to be, ‘Is the political
aspirant free? if so, take all the necessary
steps to gratify your ambition-these'
being described in such a manner as to
show that they are really the badges of
servitude. Persius is probably imitating
the way in which Horace (1 Ep. 6) puts
the question round about the true end of
life (e. g. vv. 31 foll.) ‘Virtutem verba
putas, ut Lucum ligna: cave ne portus ’
occupet alter :' campare also vv. 56 foll.
