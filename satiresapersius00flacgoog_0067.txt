the' image here rs meant to be to the
honour of Lucilius, who fastened on his
enemies without caring 101 the conse·
quences. ‘Animasque in vulnere ponunt'
Virg. G. 4. 238. Contrast the different
ways in which Hor. ll. cc. and Juv. 1. 165
characterize Lucilius with tlte present
passage.

116. omne .. vitium. Compare
such passages as Hor. a Ep. a. 105 ‘Non
es avarus: abi. Qud? cetera iam
simui isto Cum vitio fugerel' The 11-
mark is more true 01 Horace's later thau
of his earlier works, though the word
ridenti expresses a principle laid down
more than once in the Satires, e. g. 1 S.
1. 14„ 10. 14.

vafer seems 10 answer to our
‘rogue’ ‘Alfenus vrp‘er’ Hor. 1 S. 3.
130. ‘Surrentina vafer qui miscet faece
Falerua' 2 S. 4. 55. Horace is so called
because he takes his friend in.

amico is opp. 1ο ‘populum' Horace
takes his friends playfully to task for their
weaknesses, but is more contemptuous in
speaking of men in general, and mentions
obnoxious individuals even with bitter-
ness. Possibly ‘amico' may refer more
particularly to the Epistles.

117. admissus, ‘into the bosom!

praecordia is emphatic—he plays,
but 11 11 with the innermost and most
sensitive feelings.

by Plautus and Terence. See Freund.

muttire .. elam, opp. 1ο ‘muttire

(p. 145 Mun), who says 11111 ‘muttire'
there=‘loqui:' but the passage will bear
the ordinary sense.

nec (fas).

curn scrobe, because the hole in
the ground is the supposed partmr of the

- secret. The allusion, 01 course, is 101111

story 01 Midas. [⁴ Nec clam nec cum
scrobe, nusquam l' Jahn, rada]

120. infodiam, as Madau remarks,
