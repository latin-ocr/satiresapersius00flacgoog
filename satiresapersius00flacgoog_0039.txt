of himself, preserved to us by Cic. Acad.

pr. a. 16. 51, to the effect that he had ·

gone to sleep on Parnassus, seen Homer
in a dream, and heard that it was Ho-
mer’s spirit which was then animating
himself. Compare S. 6. 10, where En·

me fiere pavum,' said of Homer (Tert.
de An. 33 foll, note on 6. ιο). So Ov.

3. memini, humorous; ‘never that

1 cau remembe13' implying that Ennius
must have had a good memory.

ut repente, ‘so as to come before
the world all at once as a poet!

prodirem, ‘to corne forth from
this preparatory process,’ which is also
expressed by 'sic,’ ‘on the strength of
this' (not like ¹ sic temere,' as Casauborr
and Jahn). ‘A ready made poet by the
immediate agency of the gods! Possibly
Persius was thinking of Hor. 1 Ep. 19. 7
‘Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus
ad arma Prosiluit dicenda,' which might
also warrant a conjecture that Ennius
himself used some similar phrase.

prodirem poeta, ‘prodis e iudice
turpis Dama’ Hor. 2 S. 7. 54.

Heliconiadas better supported by
MSS. than ‘Heliconidas' Lucr. 3. 1037
‘Adde Heliconiadum comites! The re·

relates how the Muses made him a poet. ,
The form ‘Heliconis’ is however found
in Stat. Silv. 4. 4. 90, and MSS. are so
untrustworthy in the matter of proper
names that the point may be doubtful.
At any rate it is not worth while to scan
‘Heliconiadas' here by syrrizesis, as Jahn
(1843) wished, following Schneider, as pro·
per names have a metrical licence even in
tragic iambics. [⁸ Heliconidas’ Jahn 1868.]
pallidam, as causing studious pale·
ness. ‘pallentis grana cumini’ 5. 55:
perhaps with some reference to Horace's
‘expalluit haustus,’ quoted on v. 1.

Pirene, mentioned from its connec-
tion with Pegasus, who was said to have
been broken in there. Statius (Theb. 4.
60) follows or coins a story that it was
produced, like Hippocrene, by a stroke of
Pegasus’ hoof.

5. ‘To the poets, whose ivy-crowued
busts adom our public libraries! Hor.1
S. 4. 21. for the ivy, see Hor. 1 Od. 1.
²9· Juvenal apparently imitates this
passage (7. aq) ‘ut dignus venias hederis
et imagine macra.’

No sneer seems to be intended in
lambuntur sequaces, which are simply
poetical. [‘ Relinquo' Jahn (1843) ε but
‘remitto’ which he has since adopted,
has better authority]

6. semipaganus is rightly explained
by Jahn after Rigalt with reference to
the Paganalia, a festival celebrated by
members of the same pagus. Dion. Hal.

ference is perhaps to the opening of 4. 15; Sicul. Flacc. de Cond. Agr. p. 25.
