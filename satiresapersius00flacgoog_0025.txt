xxii LECTURE ΟΝ THE

duty of sincerity towards man and God, were doctrines at least as con·
genial to a Stoic as to an Epicurean, and the ambition with which the
pupil is continualiy seeking to improve upon his master's felicity of
expression shows itself more successfully in endeavours to gire greater
stringency to his rule oi iiie and conduct In one respect, certainly, we
may wonder that he has failed to represent the riews of that section of
the Stoice with which he is reported to have lived on terms oi familiar
intercourse. There is no trace of that political feeling which might have
been expected to appear in the writings of a youth who was brought
into frequent contact with the revolutionary enthusiasm of Lucan, and
may probably have been present at one of the banquets with which
Thrasea and Helvidius used to celebrate the birthdays of the first and
the last of the great republican worthies. The supposed allusions to the
poetical character of Nero in the first satire shn‘nk almost to nothing in
the light oi a searching criticism, while the tradition that in the original
draught the emperor was directly satirized as Midas receives no counte-
nance, to say the least, from the poem itseif, the very point os which, so
far as we can apprehendit, depends on the truth of the reading given in
the MSS. The fourth satire does undoubtedly touch on statesmanship:
but the tone throughout is that of a student, who in his eagerness to
imitate Plato has apparently forgotten that he is himself living not under
a popular but under an imperial government, and the moral intended to
be conveyed is simply that the adviser of the public ought to possess
some better qualification than those which were found in Alcibiades-a
topic about as appropriate to the actual state of Rome as the school·
boys exhortation to Sulla to lay down his power. Thus his language,
where he does speak, enables usto interpret his silence as the silence
not oi acquiescence or even of timidity, though such times as his might
well justiiy caution, but rather of unworldly innocence, satisfied with its
own aspirations after moral perfectiori, and dreaming of Athenian licence
under the very shade oi despotism. On the other hand, it is perfectly
intelligible that he should have seen little to admire in Seneca, many as
are the coinciriences which their common philosophy has produced in
their respective writings. There could, indeed, have been but little
sympathy between his simple earnestness and that rhetorical facility-
that Sponish taste ior inappropriate and meretricious ornament—that
tolerant and compromising temper, able to live in a court while
unable to live in exile, which, however compatible with real wisdom
and virtue, must have seemed to a Stoie of a severer type only so
many qualifications ior effectually betraying the good cause. So, again,
hc does not seem to exhibit any anticipation of the distinctly human
and reiigious development which, as we have seen, was the iinal phase
