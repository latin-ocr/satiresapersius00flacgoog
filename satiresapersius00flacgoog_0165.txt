ADDITIONAL NOTES.

r. 5. ‘Non‘, si quid turbida Roma
elevet, accedas!

Mr. J. E. Yonge, in some remarks on Conington’s and Pretor’s editions
of Persius, published in the Journal of Philology for 1873, has an excellent

note on the use of non with the present subjunctive, reminding scholars that
non accedas is in reality better Latin than ne accedas, being in fact virtually
equivalent to οὐ δεῖ προσελθεῖν, ‘it is not for you to approach: ' compare
Conington’s translation of non dubites 5. 45. ‘ Non si elevet accedas,' says
Mr. Yonge, ‘is of the same stamp as non si mesatis audias Speres, Hor. C. 1.
13. 13 3 non si solvas invenias, ib. Sat. 1. 4. 603 nec si certes concedat, Virg. Ecl.
a. 57.-[Add Ov. Pont. 1. 7 (6). 24 ‘non agites, siqua coire velis.']—The
sentence is in a conditional form, its first clauses containing a general pro-
position, its final one (ne quaesiveris) a particular precept. Thus, “you
would ( =should) not go out of your way, if public tashion decries a thing,
to notice lt or test the silly standard it sets up: and (as you would not do
this) consult no judgmeut but your own.'” Qiutilian 1. 5. 50 objects to·
saying non seceris forne feceru: 1 am not sure whether it has been noticed
that Antonius apparently broke this rule in his letter to Cicero (Art. 14. 13
A), when he said ‘non contempseris hanc familiam! Perhaps non contempseris
is equivalent to ‘you should not,’ ‘you had better not, despise.’

1. 7. ‘Trutina,’ a rough and ready balance: Cic. de Or. a. 38. 159 ‘ad ea
probanda quae nou aurificis statera sed populari quadam trutina examinantur.’

1. 9. ‘Nostrum istud vivere 3' so Plaut. Cure. 28 (Fleck.) ‘ ita tuom conferto
amare semper, si sapis!

1. 10. Comp. Prop. a. 1. 4 ‘Ingenium nobis ipsa puella facit!

1. 22-3. ‘Tun’, vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas,

auriculis, quibus et dicas cute perditus Ohe’?

Madvig notices this passage in the second volume of his Adversaria, pro·
nouncing decidedly for reading articulis instead of auriculis in the second line,
and understanding Persius to mean that the man is gouty as well as dropsical
(cute perditus). Articulis is Madvig’s conjecture, which he says is confirmed
by Priscian and two respectable MSS. of Jahn. l find in Jahn’s apparatus
no mention of any MS. support for the reading; and Keil says nothing of
it iu his edition of Priscian.

1. 48. Comp. Cic. de Or. 3. 26. 101 ‘quare beree et praeclare nobis saepe
dicatur; belle et festive nimium saepe nolo.’¹

a. 42. ‘Grandis’ of plate, Plaut. Cure. 368 (Fleck.) Cic. Verr. a. 4. ar. 47,
‘Tuccetum’ occurs also in Appuleius M. a. 7., y. 11.

a. 59· Comp. Eurip. Philoct. (fr. 792 Nauck) [ὁρᾶς δὲ] ὡς κάν θεοῖσι
κερδαίνειν καλόν, θαυμάζεται δ’ ὁ πλεῖστον ἐν ναοῖς ἔχων Χρυσόν.
