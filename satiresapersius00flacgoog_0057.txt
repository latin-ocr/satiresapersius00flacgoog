‘Est nunc Brisaei quem venosus liber Atti,

sunt quos Pacuviusque et verrucosa moretur

71. rds saturam.

‘ Communes sensus’ is used by Tac. Or. 31
for ‘common places.¹ [⁶1nc0nditi sensus’
ib. 21: ‘sensus audaces et fidem egressi'
’ Sen. Ep. 114. 1.] An antithesis is intended
between ‘heroas sensus’ and ‘nugari'

69. adferre probably in the sense of
‘bringing news! ‘Attulerunt quieta om-
nia apud Gallos esse' Livy 6. 31. Comp.
‘narrent’ v. 31. For ‘videmus' some
copies have ‘docemus' which Casaubon
and Heinr. adopt, supposing that Persius
is speaking of the compositions of boys at
school; but there seems uo reason to be-
lieve that education is referred to before
v. .

gg. nugari, v. 56 note. ‘Who used
to 'confine themselves to dilettante efforts
in Greek? Hor. 1 S. 10. 31 tells us how
he ¹once tried composing in Greek.

ponere artifices, like ‘artifex
sequi’ Prol. 11.

ponere. Prop. 2. 3. 4· ‘Hic do·
minam exemplo ponat in arte meam,'
and Paley’s note. ‘Sollers nunc hominem
ponere, nunc deum’ Hor. 4 Od. 8. 8.
which perhaps Persius imitated. [‘Pone
Tigellinum' Juv. 1. 155]

lucum is one of the commonplaces
instanced by Hor. A. P. 16, who evi·
dently intends a description of scenery,
not, as Juv. 1. 7, a mythological picture.

71. saturum, ‘fertile’ ‘Saturi petito
longinque Tarenti' Virg. G. a. 197.

laudare, ‘to eulogiae! Hor. 1 Od.
7.1 ‘Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon aut
Mitylenen!

corbes, part of the farm furniture
-baskets for gathering fruits. Cato R. R.
136. Varro R. R. 1. 50. 1 (Freund).
Since Wordsworth‚ there would be nothing

“fultas Μ’,

aerumnis cor luctificabile

74. quem-dictatorem.

incongruens in introducing these details
(except perhaps the pigs) intoa poem of
country life; but though he may have
done service in breaking down the rule of
conventional description, it does not fol·
low that poets in Persius’ time were justi·
fied in offending against the taste of their
day, as in them it probably argued a
want of perception of any kind of pro·
priety in writing whether great or small.

72. focus. Casaubon refers to Virg.
E. 5. 69, 7. 49, to which add G. a. 528.
We may observe that, in E. 7. 49, the
only place where sitting round the fire ia
dwelt on, Virgil implicitly condemns the
choice of the subject by putting it iuto the
mouth of Thyrsis, in contrast to Corydon's
description of summer and out-door life.

fumosa Palilia faeno. Compare 'l
Prop. 5. 4. 73-78 ‘Urbi festus erat: l
dixere Palilia patres: Hic primus coepit ἶ
moenibus esse dies: Annua pastorum l,
convivia, lusus in urbe, Cum pagana
madent fercula deliciis, Cumque super
raros sueni flammantis acerum Traiicit .
immundos ebria trrrba pedes!

73. The poet appears to have intro·
duced a reference to the rural glories of
Roman history. Remus is introduced
partly on account of the ‘Palilia’ which
were ontheannirersary of the foundation of
Rome (Prop. l. c), partly as having him·
self led a country life, ‘Hanc olim veteres
vitam coluere Sabini, Hanc Remus et frater'
Virg. G. a. 533. This seems better than
to understand ‘unde‘ ‘after these aute·
cedente he comes to write of Remus!

sulcoqueterens dentalia. Perhaps
imitatedfromVirg.Aeu.6.844,‘veltesulco,
Serrane, serentem! Compare also G. 1.
