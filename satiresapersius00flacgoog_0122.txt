ghles, with a trick of making vapour look solid. My voice is for
a private ear ; it is to you, at the instance of the Muse within me,

is to show you, Cornutus, how large a share of my inmost being
is yours, my beloved friend ; strike it, use every test to tell what
rings sound and what is the mere plaster of a varnished tongue.
An occasion indeed it is for which I may well venture to aska
hundred voices, that I may bring out in clear utterance how
thoroughly I have lodged you in the very corners of my breast,
and unfold in words all the unspeakable feelings which lie en·
twined deep down among my beart-strings.
