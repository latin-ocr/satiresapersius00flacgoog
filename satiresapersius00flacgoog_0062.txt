SAT. Ι. 27

thatl That monstrous fine? What, old Romulus, you turning
spanieli Am Ι to be touched forsooth and pull out a penny, if
ashipwrecked manbegins singing me a song? You sing, when
you have actually got yourself painted in awreck to carry on
your shoulders? No—'a man's tears must come from his heart
at the moment, not from his brains overnight, if he would have
me bowed down beneath his piteous tale!

F. But they have given grace and smoothness to our unpolished
Roman numbers. Thus it is a point gained to round averse
with Berecynthiun Attis and the dolphin ructuas cutting through seu-
green Nereus, or We dove folcbad off u rib from the long sudes os
Appenninus.

plies no parallel; v. 96 to the objector,
who opens another line of defence, and
the rest to Persius, who retorts as before
by quoting specimens, on which he in-
dignantly commenta. Jahn, however,
seems right in giving vv. 92-95 to the
objector, as nothing is there said ipso
facto disparaging to the poets, and in
giving vv. 96, 97 to Persius3 but he
would have done better by assigning
v.h98 qqtfto thfq quector but to Persius,

F. ‘Well, they have at any rate suc-
ceeded in giving polish to our poetry‚ aa,
for instance ..... ’ P. ‘Shade of Virgill

F. gives one. P. ‘And this is munly
poetry-mere drivelling, poured out iu·
voluntarily from an idiot's lips, not wmng
with toil from an artist's brain.'

9²· iunctura, as in v. 64, is the weld-

cyntius’ being a great point gained.
Thus there is no occasion to read 'Attin’
with three Mss, so as to produce a
jingle with ‘delphin' For artis, see
Catullus’ poem. Dio says of Nero ἐκι-
θαρῴδησε τε Ἄττιν τινὰ ἡ Βάκχαι
(61. ao).

94. qui..delphin is another nom.
to ‘didicit’ Perhaps the expression is
meant to be ridiculed as well as the
rhythm, as the image of the dolphin
cleaving Nereus is nearly as grotesque as
Furius' of Jupiter spirting snow on the
Alps (Hor. a S. 5. 41), or as Alpinus’ of
the muddy head of the Rhine (ib. 1 S.
10. 37). Valerius Flaccus, however
(1. 450, quoted by Jahn), has ‘remo
Nerea versat! The dolphin in question
may be Arion's, as the schol. thinks.
Stat. Theb. 5. 482 has ‘Spumea porrecti
dirimentes terga profundi!

95. Both expression and rhythm seem

This roughness is expressed by crudis, the jingle in the middle, like Virgil's (Aen.
though through a different metaphor. 3. 549, quoted by the schol), ‘Cor-
with ‘crudis’ compare 5. 5 ‘quantas nua velatarum obvertimus antennarum!

marks, is not merely to conclude a verse, the process of carving (compare Juv. 11.
