of tbe worshipper. The reference is to
the presence of the gods, as Jahn remarks.
45. fibra (v. 26) is said in the same ·

spirit as ‘pulmone et lactibus unctis' v. 30.

fortunare is used absolutely, as in
Afranius ap. Non. sub v., quoted by Jahn,
‘Deos ego omnes ut fortunassiut precor,'
the subj. to ‘fortunare' being ‘penates’
‘Formam' as Jahn remarks, is a ‘vox
sollennis ’ in prayers, being invariably used
of the gods. ‘Tu quamcunque Deus tibi
fortunaverit horam Grata sume manu'
Hor. 1 Ep. 11. aa.

Penatis, as gods of the ‘penus' the
domestic stote. ‘Cura penum stmere et
flammis adolere penatis' Virg. Aen. 1. 704.
