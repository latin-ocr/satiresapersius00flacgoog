palles. The paleness which Persius
attacks (v. 26) is that of debauchery and
dilettante study; but he is ready to sympa-
thize with the paleness of the genuine
student, 3. 85, 5. 62. Possibly some
connexion may be intended here, as in
v. 26, between ‘pallor' and ‘senium'-'
the student poring so long over thean-
cieuts that he catches their colour. At
any rate ‘Eupolidem pallere' is to be ex·
plained as a cogn. acc.. like ‘sapimus
patruos' (v. 11) = ‘pallere pallorem Eu·
polideum.' ‘Multos pallere colores'

Dr. Moore's Zeluco, quoted by Macau-

felt of the Greek dress, the ‘pallium’ and
‘crepidae' as likely to encroach on the

one of the things which tended to bring
