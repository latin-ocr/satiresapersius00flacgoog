for bread, which would have been too
obviously untrue, as he was a wealthy

parrot did not corne from Greece, but
simply ‘its own '-⁴ that cry which it is
now so ready with! So there is no op-
position between χαῖρε and ⁴ nostro verba,’
as if the magpie were intended to talk
Latin as distinguished from Greek. The
parrot talks Greek as the fashionable
language for' small talk, as now a days he
might talk French, while ‘nostra verba’
means human speech. The antithesis is
merely one of those which a man might
use ahnost without intending it, between
language viewed as belonging to its origi·
nal owner and as afterwards appropriated
—just as the parrot speaks ‘expedite’
while the magpie ‘conatur,' though it is
not meant that the former succeeds more
perfectly than the latter. For the prac-
tice of keeping parrots and magpies
in great houses, see Martial, referred to
below. After v. 8 a few MSS. have aline,
‘Corvos quis olim concavum salutare ?'
where ‘concavum’ would doubtless refer
to the sound, though one MS. gives
‘Caesarem' as in the first passage of
Martial.
